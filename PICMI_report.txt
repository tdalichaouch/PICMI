# UCLA_FY23.2 Enhance PICMI for community wide adoption with OSIRIS/QPAD/QuickPIC Prototype

We have extended the Particle-In-Cell Modeling Interface (PICMI) for fully relativistic, massively parallel quasi-static-based Particle-In-Cell codes QuickPIC (https://picksc.physics.ucla.edu/quickpic.html) and QPAD (https://picksc.physics.ucla.edu/qpad.html) developed at UCLA. Our implementations of the PICMI standard modules for QPAD and QuickPIC currently support initializing an arbitrary number of relativistic beams, as well as uniform and tapered plasmas for plasma-wakefield acceleration (PWFA) and beam loading problems. Our scripts also generate input decks to run with pre-compiled versions of QPAD and QuickPIC. In addition, we have also included error checking and additional optional arguments, such as predictor-corrector solver iterations, diagnostic slicing, and particle sampling, specific to each code for more flexibility and robustness. Furthermore, we have proposed new PICMI standard interfaces for electromagnetic solvers used in quasi-static codes and additional features for diagnostic reporting. The next steps for this milestone include extending our QPAD/QUICKPIC PICMI scripts to laser-wakefield problems and implementing the PICMI standard for OSIRIS (https://picksc.physics.ucla.edu/osiris.html). The most recent version of the PICMI modules for QPAD and QuickPIC can be found at https://github.com/tdalichaouch/PICMI/tree/report.

As part of our joint milestone with LBNL, we have also provided a simple two-bunch PWFA problem for optimal beam loading based on the PICMI standard format using beam parameters expected at FACET II experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). For this problem, a tri-gaussian electron driver with a spot size of 5.56 um, duration of 8.07 um, and 1 nC of charge is used to excite a nonlinear plasma wakefield in a constant density plasma (10^17 cm^-3). A second tri-gaussian trailing bunch with spot size of 1.72 um, duration of 4.03 um, and 0.3 nC of charge is located at the rear of the wake such that it loads a nearly constant accelerating electric field around its centroid. We carried out PIC simulations of this problem using our PICMI generated input decks to run QuickPIC and QPAD. The simulation results demonstrate strong agreement with those obtained from an OSIRIS-equivalent input deck (https://github.com/tdalichaouch/PICMI/blob/report/PICMI_test.jpg)
